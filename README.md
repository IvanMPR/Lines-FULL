# Lines game clone

Check my <a href="https://ivanmpr.github.io/Lines-FULL/" target="_blank">Lines</a> game.
<br>
I'm very proud for being able to present this fully functional game. I enjoyed worknig on it, especially because it forced me to learn couple new things and 
concepts in order to be able to complete it.
<br>
<a href="https://ivanmpr.github.io/Lines/" target="_blank">This</a> is where I was few weeks ago, without any knowledge about searching data algorithyms.
<br>
Rules are simple! Make a line of 5 or more consecutive balls of the same color (in a row, column or diagonally),
in order to clear them of the board and earn points.
<br>
Click on the ball to select it, click on the desired field to move it.
